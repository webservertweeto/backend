# Tweeto <img src = "/images/twitter_icon.png"/>
<p>Our application intends to serve as a service that allows users to tweet at a later time. Users will have the capability of setting what day/time a tweet should be sent and they have the option 
to delete that queued tweet before the deadline.  In addition, they can send out multiple tweets at different times. </p>
